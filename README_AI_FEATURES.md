## **Demo Script for Clients** (2-3 minutes)

### **Open the app and say:**

> "I've built an advanced e-commerce app with cutting-edge AI features. Let me show you three things that make this special:
>
> **First - AI Recommendations:** [Scroll home screen] When users browse products, our AI learns their preferences and shows personalized suggestions. See these items with "AI Pick" badges? That's real AI analysis. This drives higher engagement and sales.
>
> **Second - 24/7 AI Chatbot:** [Navigate to /ai/chatbot] Customers can chat anytime to get product recommendations, answers to questions, and shopping help. It's powered by Google's Gemini AI - the most advanced language model. This eliminates wait times and reduces support costs.
>
> **Third - Visual Search:** [Navigate to /ai/visual-search] Instead of typing product names, users can describe what they want. They might say 'black formal shoes with leather' and AI instantly finds matching products. It's more intuitive and increases user satisfaction.
>
> All three features are powered by Google's latest AI technology. The app also has premium UI design, smooth animations, and works perfectly on mobile and web. This is a production-ready application ready to launch!"
