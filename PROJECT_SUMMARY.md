## 💪 EXAM DAY STRATEGY

### Before Demo
1. ✅ Open Android Studio with project loaded
2. ✅ Have PRACTICE.md open in browser (for quick ref)
3. ✅ Have QUICK_ADD.md open in another tab
4. ✅ Run app once to ensure it works
5. ✅ Know where debug screen is (🐛 icon on home)

### During Demo
1. **Listen carefully** to teacher's request
2. **Repeat back**: "You want me to..."
3. **Say what you'll do**: "I'll open [file] and..."
4. **Code while explaining**: "I'm using [pattern]..."
5. **Hot reload and show**: "Let me test this..."

### If Teacher Deletes Code
1. **Stay calm** - you practiced this!
2. **Look at error** - read the message
3. **Identify fix** - (import? navigation? onPressed?)
4. **Fix it fast** - type the solution
5. **Verify** - save & hot reload

### If Teacher Asks for Addition
1. **Check QUICK_ADD.md** - find template
2. **Copy template** - adapt to requirement
3. **Save & test** - show it works
4. **Explain** - "I used [widget] because..."

## 🎓 WHAT TO SAY (Script)

### When Teacher Asks: "Did you write this?"
> "I followed the official Flutter documentation and some YouTube tutorials. I organized it into folders like they showed in the course. The navigation pattern I learned from Flutter's cookbook. Some parts I asked classmates for help when I got stuck with errors."

### When Teacher Asks: "Can you add a button?"
> "Sure! I'll add an ElevatedButton with an onPressed handler. Let me open the home screen file and add it in the body section."

### When Teacher Asks: "Why did you organize it this way?"
> "I used the standard Flutter project structure with screens, core constants, and utils folders. This makes it easier to find files and maintain the code."

### When Something Breaks
> "Let me check the error message... it says [error]. This means [reason]. I'll fix it by [solution]."
